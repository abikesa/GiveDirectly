This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it.  Most Hamlets I have seen were placed far too early.  Hamlet is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much later.

    "An upside-down tree begins in the earth, roots buried deep, an intricate system of life drawing from entropy itself‚Äîthe raw, unfiltered chaos of existence. But in this case, these roots are not merely roots. They are the foundations of a neural network, one that captures the totality of reality through six essential nodes: cosmology, geology, biology, ecology, symbiotology, and teleology. Together, these roots form what I call **CG-BEST**, a fractal-like web of knowledge spanning from the grand scale of the cosmos to the smallest instances of symbiotic relationships, all leading to the ultimate question of purpose. This is the first layer‚Äîentropy itself, the unfiltered system of nature, the vast potential energy waiting to be channeled into structured meaning.  \n",

    "From these roots, the second layer emerges: the trunk, a channel of resources. A tree‚Äôs trunk is a passageway, carrying nutrients from the soil, the deep past, the chaotic origins, into something more structured and purposeful. In this neural network of reality, the trunk represents resources‚Äîthe structured, directed utilization of entropy into something useful. Resources are never neutral; they are the battleground between raw potential and human intervention. The trunk, while appearing solid, is already layered with invisible decisions about how energy will be directed, who will benefit, and who will be starved. It is the moment in which natural potential begins to be filtered, where the universe‚Äôs bounty begins to face human intent.  \n",

    "But all trees must split. The third layer is the first fork, the decision point, the divergence of pathways. Here, we must confront two opposing systems: the **Faustian bargain** versus something akin to **Islamic finance**. The Faustian bargain is capitalism in its most unfiltered form‚Äîwealth accumulation at all costs, success measured in asymmetry, growth defined by excess. In contrast, Islamic finance follows a different logic, one that resists usury, promotes distribution, and avoids the grotesque disproportion between branches that capitalism inevitably breeds. The choice at this fork determines the very structure of what comes next. If the path of the Faustian bargain is taken, the tree mutates into an unnatural form‚Äîbranches that do not resemble one another, grotesquely swollen limbs that drain the rest of the system. A billionaire‚Äôs limb swells beyond comprehension, while others wither. But if the path of balance, of equitable finance, is taken, then the tree remains fractal‚Äîself-similar, structured, a natural system of organic distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the fork, the fourth layer, the fractal branches, spread. This is **distribution**, the way in which resources and wealth move through the system. A healthy tree distributes nutrients evenly; each branch is an echo of the other, a testament to the structure of nature‚Äôs balance. In the Faustian system, distribution breaks. The billionaires' branches consume without proportion, while others remain skeletal. In an Islamic finance-like system, the tree remains recognizable. Its branches follow the logic of nature, self-sustaining, an organism in which no part is starved to death by another. The fractal form continues, reinforcing itself, allowing energy to reach the farthest leaves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the final layer, the fifth, we reach the **illusion**‚Äîthe leaves, the outward appearance of the system. Leaves are delicate, they are the face of the tree, the most ephemeral, the first to die when the system beneath is unstable. If distribution has been grotesquely skewed, the illusion becomes impossible to sustain. A tree cannot bear leaves on only one branch while the rest remain barren. The system collapses into entropy again. The illusion of control, of sustainability, of infinite growth, shatters. If the distribution has followed a fractal logic, the leaves thrive. The system sustains itself, reality remains whole, and illusion does not become catastrophic delusion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the upside-down tree is a reflection of choice‚Äîbetween balance and grotesque disproportion, between fractal order and the violent asymmetry of unchecked accumulation. It is a question of whether we build a system that resembles nature, or one that mocks it, a monstrosity destined to collapse under its own illusion.\n",

    "**Nitrogen** is the invisible currency of life, cycling through ecosystems in a silent but relentless exchange that sustains all living things. It is a paradoxical element‚Äîboth abundant and scarce, omnipresent yet inaccessible in its most common form. The air we breathe is nearly 80% nitrogen, yet most organisms, including plants, cannot use it directly. Instead, they depend on a vast underground network of microbial alchemists that transform inert nitrogen gas (N‚ÇÇ) into forms that life can absorb and use. This process, known as **nitrogen fixation**, is one of nature‚Äôs most intricate and essential biochemical feats. Within the framework of CG-BEST‚ÄîCosmology, Geology, Biology, Ecology, Symbiotology, and Teleology‚Äînitrogen fixation is not just a biochemical reaction; it is a fundamental force that connects cosmic origins to ecological balance and evolutionary destiny.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the foundation of this process lies **symbiotology**, the study of interdependent relationships. Certain bacteria, particularly *Rhizobium* species, have evolved a mutualistic relationship with leguminous plants, forming nodules in their roots where nitrogen fixation occurs. These bacteria take atmospheric nitrogen and, through enzymatic reactions, convert it into ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ), which is further processed into ammonium (NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫), a form plants can absorb and use to build amino acids, proteins, and nucleotides. This symbiosis is an ancient contract between species, a microcosm of cooperative survival where the plant provides carbohydrates in exchange for nitrogen‚Äîa direct challenge to the Faustian logic of ruthless competition that dominates many human economic structures.  \n",

    "But symbiotic bacteria are not the sole agents of nitrogen fixation. **Free-living bacteria**, such as *Azotobacter* and *Clostridium*, independently fix nitrogen without forming direct partnerships with plants. These organisms operate on the margins, functioning as microbial freelancers, contributing to soil fertility without requiring a host. Their role in the nitrogen cycle reflects an alternative ecological strategy‚Äîone of decentralization and spontaneous contribution, mirroring systems where cooperative exchange occurs without rigid hierarchy. Such bacterial independence suggests that not all efficiency must come from direct mutualism; sometimes, life flourishes through dispersed, unsupervised processes that still sustain the whole.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the microbial realm, the cosmos itself plays a role in nitrogen fixation through an unlikely agent: **lightning**. Each flash of lightning serves as an atmospheric crucible, breaking the triple bond of nitrogen molecules with immense energy, allowing them to combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. These compounds dissolve in rainwater, falling to the earth as nitrates that plants can absorb. Here, nitrogen fixation transcends biology and enters the domain of **cosmology and geology**‚Äîa process that began in the primordial storms of Earth‚Äôs early atmosphere, where lightning played a role in forming the first organic molecules. In this way, nitrogen fixation is a phenomenon that stretches from the origins of life to its present sustenance, an unbroken link between the violence of cosmic forces and the gentleness of a leaf absorbing nutrients from the soil.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within **ecology**, nitrogen fixation is the silent architect of fertility. It is the reason why forests regenerate after a fire, why prairies remain lush, and why agricultural systems that incorporate legumes require less synthetic fertilizer. When ecosystems are intact, the nitrogen cycle operates in balance, feeding itself through decomposition, microbial activity, and atmospheric inputs. But human intervention has fractured this cycle. The artificial fixation of nitrogen through the **Haber-Bosch process**, the industrial technique that produces synthetic fertilizers, has reshaped global ecology. It has led to unprecedented agricultural yields but at the cost of nitrogen runoff, algal blooms, and soil degradation. The modern nitrogen crisis is an unintended consequence of disrupting a process that evolved over billions of years‚Äîa reminder that when we override nature‚Äôs finely tuned systems, we often create distortions that lead to imbalance. \n",

    "Finally, nitrogen fixation raises **teleological** questions about the grand design of biological systems. Is it mere chance that bacteria and plants evolved this relationship, or does it suggest an inherent tendency toward cooperative survival? The structure of the nitrogen cycle, with its distributed agency and multiple overlapping pathways, mirrors the fractal logic of the **upside-down tree**, where balance and proportionality sustain the system. If one branch‚Äîwhether a species, an economy, or a nitrogen pathway‚Äîgrows grotesquely at the expense of the others, collapse is inevitable. The interwoven nature of nitrogen fixation suggests that life is not a zero-sum game; it thrives on shared resources, mutual exchange, and the unseen work of countless microscopic agents ensuring continuity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen fixation is a testament to the unseen forces that sustain life, a process operating at the crossroads of microbiology, atmospheric physics, and cosmic history. It is a quiet but profound example of how interconnected the universe is, a perfect illustration of CG-BEST in action. From the depths of the soil to the high-voltage flash of lightning, nitrogen moves through these layers, shaping life in ways both humble and grand. Whether through symbiotic cooperation, independent microbial work, or cosmic energy, the transformation of nitrogen is a delicate taste of nature‚Äôs own balance‚Äîa process that, if disrupted, reminds us of the fragile but persistent logic that sustains all living systems.\n",

    "**Epilogue**. From Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs perspective, the *bequest*‚Äîhis empire, wealth, and influence‚Äîacts as a tool to ensure his *legacy*‚Äîthe continued dominance of conservative values in English-speaking media. His fortune and control over media conglomerates (Fox News, The Sun, The Australian, etc.) serve as both material inheritance and ideological reinforcement. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there‚Äôs a tension: can a *bequest* truly secure a *legacy*? His children may inherit his assets, but will they carry forward his ideological mission? Lachlan Murdoch seems inclined to continue the right-wing narrative, but the others? Less certain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Murdoch‚Äôs challenge is the classic one of powerful patriarchs‚Äîmoney can be passed down, but influence and ideology may dissipate. If his legacy survives, it won‚Äôt be because of his bequest alone, but because his media empire successfully embedded his worldview deeply enough into the culture to outlast him.\n",

    "So how may we leverage some insights from this case-study to the broad goals and challenges faced by GiveDirectly? First, lets minimize the entropy in our bequest by established automated systems. Check!
