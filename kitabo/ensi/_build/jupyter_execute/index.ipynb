    "# Strategic Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "**TO:** Nick Allardice CEO, GiveDirectly  \n",
    "**FROM:** Sarah Kayongo, VP, Programs Candidate  \n",
    "**DATE:** March 21, 2025  \n",
    "**SUBJECT:** Strategic Planning Recommendations: Country Footprint, Crisis Response, and Allocation of $100M in Flexible Funding  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Country Footprint Adjustments (Next 2–3 Years)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** Prioritize strategic deepening over geographic expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Actions:**\n",
    "- **Exit or pause operations** in geographies with sustained delivery or fraud challenges (e.g., **DRC**, currently paused and high-risk).\n",
    "- **Double down** in high-impact, scalable markets: **Rwanda**, **Kenya**, and **Togo**. These countries offer strong government partnerships, operational track records, and data for long-term investment.\n",
    "- **Pilot programs** in 1–2 strategically chosen, underrepresented regions (e.g., **Sahel** or **Horn of Africa**) where climate-driven poverty is acute and digital infrastructure (e.g., mobile money) is emerging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "Chasing new country launches dilutes focus and risks executional mediocrity. Instead, we should become *the* global benchmark for cash delivery excellence in a concentrated footprint, then scale outward with political capital, data, and brand trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. $5M Investment in Crisis Response Footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** Build modular, tech-enabled crisis response infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allocation Plan:**\n",
    "- **$1.5M** – Develop a central Crisis Response Playbook + surge staffing system (including rosters, contracts, and SOPs).\n",
    "- **$1.5M** – Stand up *pre-cleared, ready-to-launch* emergency programs in 3–4 diverse geographies (e.g., Nigeria, Turkey, Mozambique, Yemen).\n",
    "- **$1M** – Pre-position tech systems (beneficiary ID pipelines, payment rails, satellite/AI targeting tools).\n",
    "- **$1M** – Localized risk and safeguarding capacity-building in fragile contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "Speed is everything in a crisis—but speed without integrity can kill trust. We must design crisis readiness like a startup: lean, modular, and nimble. This $5M should act as a *force multiplier*, not a shallow band-aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Allocation of $100M in Unrestricted Funds (Africa)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Principle:** Cash is not enough—cash plus dignity, data, and durable exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allocation Framework:**\n",
    "- **$60M** – Expand *sustained* basic income pilots in **Kenya** and **Rwanda**, generating gold-standard evidence and long-term impact.\n",
    "- **$20M** – Launch adaptive, time-bound livelihood boosts in **Nigeria**, **Malawi**, and **Uganda** with localized exit strategies.\n",
    "- **$10M** – Contingency and innovation: test digital ID-linked transfers in refugee populations or climate-vulnerable regions (e.g., Lake Chad Basin).\n",
    "- **$10M** – Operational backbone: invest in talent, fraud detection, and safeguarding systems to de-risk future scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact View:**  \n",
    "This is not just about poverty alleviation—it’s about institutional credibility and global agenda-setting. Let’s not just be effective; let’s be *undeniable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** GiveDirectly should become not just the best executor of cash transfers, but the global authority on how to do it *with trust, speed, and dignity*. The opportunity is here—and the world is watching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respectfully,  \n",
    "Sarah Kayongo \n",
    "VP of Programs  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like a separate memo for the safeguarding incident response next?"
